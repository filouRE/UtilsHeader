# UtilsHeader
A small Utils header that helps you save time by only needing to include one file but get the power of many!

## Documentation
Right now, the header is just starting out and therefore I didn't add a lot of features yet. If you want to contribute you can do for sure but I'll just make sure that the code is following the same patterns, guidelines and conventions. I'll post all of the conventions and guidelines in later commits.

### Strings
- String class currently contains
    - **Instantiation**
    - **Moving**

        - Returns the length (number of characters) in the string
